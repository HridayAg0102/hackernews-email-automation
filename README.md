directory tree

└── pythonProject/
    ├── main.py
    └── assets and md/
        ├── project_details.md
        ├── img.png
        └── img_1.png
```

just need to run main.py for execution, but certain steps are to be followed before-hand:
1. edit you credentials in the `main.py` file
2. change your google account settings of the sender email address.
```
a) go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
b) Turn "ON" Less Secure App Access as shown below
